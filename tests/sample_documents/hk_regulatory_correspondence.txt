Re: Trade Reconciliation Deficiencies — Follow-Up

Dear Ms. Chen,

Further to our on-site examination conducted in August 2025, we write to communicate the following expectations regarding the identified trade reconciliation deficiencies at your Hong Kong operations.

1. FORMAL REMEDIATION PLAN

We request submission of a formal remediation plan addressing the trade reconciliation control deficiencies within 60 days of this correspondence. The plan must include specific milestones, resource allocation, and target completion dates.

2. PROGRESS REPORTING

Quarterly progress updates are required commencing January 2026, to be submitted to the Supervision Division by the 15th of each quarter-end month.

3. DEADLINE COMPLIANCE

We note the internal deadline of March 31, 2026 for critical finding remediation. Failure to meet this deadline may result in enhanced supervisory measures, including increased capital requirements and on-site monitoring.

4. SPECIFIC AREAS OF CONCERN

Our examination specifically identified gaps in cross-border transaction monitoring controls, particularly relating to the reconciliation of FX and equity settlement transactions processed through the SWIFT messaging gateway.

We expect a formal response within 30 days.

Yours sincerely,
[HKMA Supervision Division]
