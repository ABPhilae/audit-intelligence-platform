Document Reference: TRA-2025-H1-APAC
Author: Dr. Akiko Yamamoto, Regional Technology Risk Lead
Date: August 2025
Classification: INTERNAL — APAC_AUDIT, GLOBAL_AUDIT

Executive Summary

The overall APAC technology risk rating is Elevated, up from Moderate in the H2 2024 assessment. This escalation is driven by three factors: outdated core systems (TRS, AML Engine), increasing cloud dependency without adequate risk controls, and the growing complexity of cross-border data flows.

Technology Systems Inventory

The following systems are in scope:

Trade Reconciliation System (TRS) — version 5.2, last updated December 2023. Supports manual and semi-automated reconciliation for equity, fixed income, and FX trades. Current capacity: 50,000 transactions per day. Required capacity by Q2 2026: 75,000.

AML Screening Engine v4.1 — deployed June 2023, parameters last calibrated Q2 2024. Screens all wire transfers against sanctions lists, PEP databases, and internal watchlists. Processes approximately 12,000 screening events per day.

FX Trading Platform v3.8 — deployed March 2024. Handles spot and forward FX transactions for all APAC offices.

SWIFT Messaging Gateway — standard messaging interface for cross-border payments.

Regional Compliance Dashboard — IN DEVELOPMENT. Planned for Q2 2026. Will provide real-time monitoring of compliance metrics across all APAC offices.

Document Management System (DMS) — stores all audit reports, policies, and correspondence.

Risk Assessment

Overall APAC Risk Rating: ELEVATED (up from Moderate)

Primary drivers:
- Insufficient trade reconciliation controls in Hong Kong
- Outdated AML screening parameters
- Technology risk assessment framework does not cover cloud services
- Increasing regulatory scrutiny from HKMA

Training Requirements

AML refresher training: mandatory completion by Q2 2026 for all compliance staff
New compliance monitoring tools training: scheduled Q1 2026
Cross-border regulation awareness workshops: quarterly starting Q1 2026
Trade reconciliation system training for HK operations staff: upon TRS upgrade completion
