            "ground_truth": "The overall APAC risk rating is Elevated, up from Moderate in the previous assessment, primarily driven by increased regulatory scrutiny, trade reconciliation gaps in Hong Kong, and outdated AML screening parameters.",

            "question": "Compare the risk levels between Hong Kong and Singapore.",
            "ground_truth": "Hong Kong has a higher overall risk level with 3 critical and 2 significant findings, primarily in trade reconciliation and AML controls.

            "ground_truth": "The strategy review reports digital transformation is 60% complete with an accelerated timeline. However, the audit report found that key systems like TRS have not been updated since 2023, suggesting the transformation has not yet addressed critical operational systems. The strategy review increased compliance technology budget by 20%, which aligns with the audit's recommendation for system upgrades.",

            "question": "Which findings require both technology upgrades AND process changes?",
            "ground_truth": "The trade reconciliation finding requires both a TRS system upgrade (technology) and new escalation procedures for breaks above HKD 500,000 (process). The AML screening finding requires engine parameter updates (technology) and quarterly calibration review procedures (process). Both findings span the two budget categories.",

        {
            "question": "What is the relationship between the AML compliance policy and the audit findings?",
            "ground_truth": "The AML Compliance Policy v3.2 sets the requirements that the audit tested against. The audit found that the AML Screening Engine does not meet the policy's requirement for screening against FATF-updated parameters, that the 24-hour escalation window mandated by the policy was breached 12 times, and that the quarterly reporting to the regional compliance officer has been inconsistent.",
            "category": "multi_hop"

        {
            "question": "What are the top 3 risks that could prevent timely remediation?",
            "ground_truth": "The top risks are: (1) vendor delays in delivering the upgraded TRS platform, with the current vendor estimating a 4-month development cycle that leaves no buffer before the March deadline; (2) staff capacity constraints as the same team handles both BAU audit work and remediation; (3) potential scope creep if the HKMA adds additional requirements based on their ongoing review.",

            "question": "Summarize the main themes across all uploaded documents.",
            "ground_truth": "The main themes are: regulatory compliance gaps in APAC driven by outdated systems and screening parameters, urgent need for technology modernisation especially in trade reconciliation and AML systems, increasing regulatory scrutiny from HKMA requiring formal remediation plans, strategic pivot toward digital transformation with dedicated budget, talent development needs across compliance and technology, and a shift from reactive to proactive risk management through quarterly reviews and a regional compliance dashboard.",
            "category": "synthesis"
        },
        {
            "question": "Based on the documents, what should be the top priority for the next 90 days?",
            "ground_truth": "The top priority should be completing the Trade Reconciliation System upgrade in Hong Kong, as it addresses the most critical finding, is under HKMA scrutiny with a formal remediation plan expected within 60 days, and has the tightest deadline of March 31, 2026. This should run in parallel with AML screening parameter updates which are less complex and can be completed by the same deadline.",

            "question": "How does the technology risk assessment framework handle cloud services?",
            "ground_truth": "The current technology risk assessment framework does not adequately cover cloud services and third-party API dependencies — this was flagged as a significant finding. The remediation plan includes extending the framework to cover cloud-specific risks including data residency, API security, vendor lock-in, and service availability SLAs by June 30, 2026.",
            "category": "factual"
        },
        {
            "question": "What monitoring and reporting cadence is established for remediation tracking?",
            "ground_truth": "Critical findings require monthly progress reports to the Audit Committee with formal status updates from finding owners. Significant findings require quarterly reporting. The Regional Compliance Dashboard, once operational, will provide real-time tracking. Additionally, the HKMA requires quarterly progress updates on trade reconciliation remediation specifically.",
            "category": "multi_hop"

            "question": "What does the finding tracker show about the distribution of findings by severity across regions?",
            "ground_truth": "Hong Kong has the highest concentration with 3 critical and 2 significant findings. Singapore has 2 significant findings and no critical findings. Tokyo has 1 minor finding related to documentation gaps. Sydney has 1 minor finding related to operational process dependencies. Total: 3 critical, 4 significant, 2 minor across the APAC region.",
